                        <p>Methods, apparatus, and processor-readable storage media for identifying and determining the criticality of enterprise assets using network traffic information are provided herein. An example computer-implemented method includes capturing network session information from an enterprise network; identifying multiple assets within the enterprise network by processing the captured network session information; determining, for each of the identified assets, one or more predefined features of the asset based at least in part on the processing of the captured network session information; determining, for each of the identified assets, a level of criticality associated with the asset based at least in part on the one or more determined features of the asset; and outputting the level of criticality and an identifier of the asset associated therewith to a security-related system, wherein the level of criticality and the asset identifier are used by the security-related system to take at least one automated action.</p>
